Before running the project for the first time, ensure you have a MongoDB database set up. If you donâ€™t have data in your MongoDB database, follow these steps:

    1.Navigate to the dbConnection folder in the backend directory.
    2.Open dbConnection.js.
    3.Uncomment the seedData() function.
    4.Start the backend server. This will insert initial data into your database.
    5.After the initial run, stop the server and comment out the seedData() function again.
    6.Restart the server.

After completing these steps, you should see the products in the frontend.
